**Project Title:** 

SecureImageUpload

**Description:**

SecureImageUpload is a simple web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and securely upload images. 

**Features:**

**1. User Authentication:** Users can sign up for a new account or log in using their credentials. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database.

**2. Image Upload:** Authenticated users can upload images to the server. Uploaded images are securely stored, and only authorized users can access or modify their own uploaded images.

**3. JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens are used for authentication. Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and sent to the client, which is then used to authenticate subsequent requests.

**4. Authorization:** Protected routes ensure that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities, such as uploading images.

**Technologies Used:**

1. Frontend: **React.js**
2. Backend: **Node.js, Express.js**
3. Database: **MongoDB**
4. Authentication: **JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt**
5. File Upload: **Multer**
